                Welcome to New Student Orientation (NSO) for the College of Science! 
                The rules of this scavenger hunt are simple. The 7 stops on this scavenger hunt are the 7 
                major buildings of the College of Science. OUTSIDE the main entrance at each building, exactly 
                where the picture indicates, you will find a PSSC member with a sign displaying a challenge question 
                related to the department whose building you are visiting. Input your answer into this website as you 
                progress through the hunt and, after you have visited all 7 locations and answered the challenge questions, 
                enter the names of your teammates and their PUIDâ€™s into the website to be entered into our raffle! 
                Even though you completed this scavenger hunt as a team, the raffle will be done on an individual basis. Good luck!
            </p>
