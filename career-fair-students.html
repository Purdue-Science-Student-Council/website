                                Each company will be stationed at a booth with representatives. Students will approach
                                the representatives, introduce themselves, present their resumes, and discuss
                                opportunities at the company. Students can make connections, learn more about employment
                                positions, and find out what companies are looking for. Many representatives bring
                                materials about the company for students to review at a later time. Career fairs are a
                                great opportunity for students at any point in their academic career and we encourage
                                everyone to come.

                                    Create and update your resume. An effective resume should be clear and concise by
                                    highlighting relevant skills and achievements. You should emphasize relevant
                                    coursework, experience, projects and activities, and awards. The CCO has <a

                                    Get to know the attending companies. Before the fair, learn about the companies
                                    through their website so you know which ones you want to speak with the most. You
                                    should learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a position you are
                                    interested in. As you speak to the representatives, let them know what you were most
                                    excited to learn. This will show the companies that you are invested in their
                                    company and enthusiastic about working for them. <br> <br>

                                    Create an elevator pitch. These pitches are usually a minute long and prioritize the
                                    important information about you. An elevator pitch is a brief introduction of who
                                    you are, your accomplishments and skills, and what your professional goals are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Introduction: Include your name, your area of study, and your year in school.
                                    Accomplishments and skills: Include projects, internships, research, service, and
                                    leadership. Relate the skills you've learned from these experiences to the
                                    responsibilities of the position you are interested in. <br><br>
                                    Professional goals: Highlight what kind of roles you are interested in, as well as
                                    internships or jobs. <br> <br>
                                    Practice as much as much as you can so it becomes second nature. <a
